# MyRESales
My 1st project! I downloaded 10 years of agent stats from the multiple listing system for Dutchess County. That was 10 years of 800-1000 agents each year (the number 
of active agents vary each year) and made a table for each year.
Then I crafted a SQL query to pull out my info for each year.
I hadn't figured out how to have that info go from the SQL server directly into Tableau in a form I can use yet (next project).
So I cleaned up the info in Google Sheets.
Then imported to Tableau Public.
I made some sheets and a dashboard.

So the orginal question was should I continue in real estate? And using data I think my answer is no!
